Please answer the below Data Structure Questions:

why do we need data structure?
way to store multiple data in one object
to store multiple type of values in one single object

What are the various operations that can be performed on different Data Structures?
we can create add remove sort compare etc.

List out the areas in which data structures are applied extensively?
numerical analysis, operating system, compiler design, database management, graphics, and statistical analysis,
machine learning

what is an Array?
An array is a container object that we can store multiple values in it

what is the difference between the Array and ArrayList?
Array is a fixed length data structure whereas ArrayList is a variable length Collection class. We cannot change
length of array once created in Java but ArrayList can be changed.

what is LinkedList?
is a list uses nodes to store data

How is an Array different from Linked List?
array list is using array behind array list there are arrays
behind linkedL ist there is non array there is nodes

what is queue?
is a collection its apply the concept of of fifo lilo
first in first out last in last out

what is stack?
is a collection under list using the concept FILO fist in last out

what is FIFO and LIFO?
first in first out
last int fist out

what is the order of complexity?
Summary. Time complexity describes how the runtime of an algorithm changes depending on the amount of input data.
The most common complexity classes are (in ascending order of complexity): O(1), O(log n), O(n), O(n log n), O(n²)


what is the best case to search an element from an array?
when element is first or last element in the array

what is the worst case to search an element from an array?
the worse case is O(N)

what is tree in data structure?
A tree is a hierarchical data structure defined as a collection of nodes

what is graph in data structure?
A graph is pictorial representation of a set of objects where some pairs of objects are
connected by link. The interconnected objects are represented by points termed as
vertices are called edges.

what is the difference between the HashTable and HashMap?
HashMap allows one null key and multiple null values whereas Hashtable doesn't allow any null key or value


What are the major data structures used in the following areas : RDBMS, Network data model and Hierarchical data model.
RDBMS = Array (i.e. Array of structures)
Graph = Network data model
Trees = Hierarchical data model

How HashMap works in java?


What is ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException in java? When it occurs?
whenever you are trying to use any index it doesn't exit

What are the different ways of copying an array into another array?

What is difference between an array and a linked list?
An array element is having index number, but a node is having reference to next node.
In array each element is independent, does not have any connection to the other element
         on the other hand in linked list each node are connected by previous node.
In Linked list, location or address of elements is stored in the link part of previous
         element/node. In array, no pointers are used like linked list so no need of extra space
         in memory for pointer.
Linked list consumed extra memory as the link location need to be saved in in the linked
        part of the previous elements in case of array it is not required.


What is DFS and BFS?
FS(Breadth First Search) uses Queue data structure for finding the shortest path. DFS(Depth First Search) uses
Stack data structure

What is Recursion?
its a method it called it self

What are linear and non linear data Structures?
In a linear data structure, data elements are arranged in a linear order where each and every elements are
attached to its previous and next adjacent. In a non-linear data structure, data elements are attached in hierarchically
manner

What is Big-(O)-notation?
we use for talking about how long an algorithm takes to run or how much memory is used by algorithm,
Outlined different kind of sorting algorithm with time complexity?

Draw a table with time complexity in which it will summarize all the data structure feature's advantages and disadvantages.
  a)In terms of Accessing element.
  b)In terms of Inserting element.
  c)In terms of Searching element.
  d)In terms of Removing element.
